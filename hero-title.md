The author evaluates various full-face respirator options from budget models at $120 to military-grade masks at $199, emphasizing that half-face respirators and goggles are inadequate substitutes for full coverage. Beyond gear recommendations, the piece explores how widespread gas mask adoption among protesters contradicted government narratives of riots, suggesting that people acquire such equipment precisely to avoid violent confrontation and continue peaceful demonstration.
